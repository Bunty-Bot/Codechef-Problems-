# Question:-
#   Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program. 
#   Program is very simple, given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers.
  
# Input:-
#   The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains two Integers A and B.
  
# Output:-
#   For each test case, add A and B and display it in a new line.
  
# Constraints:-
#   1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
#   0 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000
  
# Example:-
#   Input
# 3 
# 1 2
# 100 200
# 10 40

# Output
# 3
# 300
# 50

# Code:-
#This code is made by bunty_14
#Add two Numbers

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    str = input().split()
    a = int(str[0])
    b = int(str[1])
    ans = a + b
    print(ans)
